\section{Definition}

Consider the consecutive primes $p_1 = 19$ and $p_2 = 23$. It can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by $p_1$ whilst also being divisible by $p_2$.\\

In fact, with the exception of $p_1 = 3$ and $p_2 = 5$, for every pair of consecutive primes, $p_2 > p_1$, there exist values of $n$ for which the last digits are formed by $p_1$ and $n$ is divisible by $p_2$. Let $S$ be the smallest of these values of $n$.\\

Find $\sum S$ for every pair of consecutive primes with $5 \leq p_1 \leq 1000000$.
